![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dc2208d-24f2-4b74-bdf7-e01fe8afd57b)


## Overview

This repository contains the Simscape-based MATLAB model of a BLDC motor-driven electric bicycle. The model includes a detailed electrical representation of the motor and drive system, featuring inverter switching, Hall sensor-based electronic commutation, and closed-loop PID speed control for realistic simulation and control analysis.

## Features

- **Simscape BLDC Motor Model** with customizable electrical parameters  
- **Three-Phase Inverter** for motor driving  
- **Hall Sensor-Based Commutation** for rotor position detection  
- **Closed-Loop PID Speed Control** for smooth and stable motor response  

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ketan6789/Design-and-Development-of-a-Bicycle-Based-on-BLDC-Motor-Drive.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Simscape model:
   ```matlab
   open('BLDC_PWM_control.slx')
   ```
4. Run the simulation and observe the performance of the BLDC drive system.
